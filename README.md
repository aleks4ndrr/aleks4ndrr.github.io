# 30 Minute Film Festival Website

When we were first tasks with the project to complete a whole short film, including brainstorming, shooting, and editing, in just 30 minutes, I had no idea what to do. However, as the clock kept on ticking, Sabrina and I decided that we should create a short film, decidated to the many of the campus cats that we have here at NYUAD. In the scortching heat of Abu Dhabi, we went outside and began filming the few felines that we had encountered, improvising the possible scenes as we went.

## Project Description

After creating the intial video, I began brainstorming possibilities of how to display the film that we had made, and what is the right design for the website. After all, I am still new to front-end development, however, I decided to challenge myself in certain aspects. When designing the wireframe for the website, I had envisioned a simple yet effective and communicative design, with no extra "fluff." I wanted the opening frame of the website however, feel as if the end user is entering an interesting and modern designed artistic website. I decided to include a sort of "splash screen" which would prompt the users to interact with the website before they even get to the main content. I believe that this is an effective strategy at catching or hooking the audiences attention, as we are usually accustomed to see a lot of information throw at us at once when we open the website. This element, allows for the users to slow down their browsing, and take a few more moments before delving into the content. Similarly, I attempted to create a minimalistic structure and design for the website, including only the most essential pieces of information that I wanted to communicate. Additionally, I had chosen a simple color pallette, that makes the whole website more aesthetically pleasing.

## Process

As I began crafting the website, I had decided to create the entire website from scratching, fully writing my own HTML, CSS, and JS markups/code.
