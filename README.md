# Welcome To My Portfolio

My name is Oleksandr Anyshchenko, I am currently a sophmore studying Computer Science at New York University Abu Dhabi. I love learning about technology, and I try my best to improve my skills with each day.

## Initial Wireframe Design

As I designed the wireframe for my website, I was quite ambitious with the amout of pages and web elements that I wanted to include. I found myself challenged by the short time-frame to implement the portfolio project into reality. However, little by little the final website started coming together.

## Building the Website

Building a full website from scratch is no easy task. Even with a fairly good understanding of the three main components of the web -- HTML CSS and JS -- I found it especially challenging to build the website because of the sheer amount of markup and code language needed.

Along with that, I had also found myself changing a few design choices and positionings avertly from the wireframe I initially came up with. I found that these changes let me express myself in a unique way through the web, keeping the website minimalistic yet also serving as an abstract piece of art.

When working on a contact form, I came to realize that Github Pages doesn't support server-side languages (PHP which I wanted to use for email processing), I had to go with an external API based approach to recieve the responses from the contact form.

## Reflection

Ultimately, this project took a lot of time, a lot more than I had expected. However, I believe that I had successfully implemented and deployed a solid website, that has a clean and responsive design, which I can develop further with time and use as a powerful tool to help advance my career in tech.
