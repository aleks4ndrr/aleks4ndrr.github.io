          It was the 24th of February, 2022, and Denis was peacefully sleeping,
          dreaming of all the exciting events that he had been preparing for. He
          had been working so hard the past few weeks, preparing to present his
          new project that would lend him opportunities he had only dreamed of.

          All of the the sudden, a loud <span class="bang">BANG</span> woke him
          up. His windows shaking, books falling off the table, and a dark and
          painful reality had began to settle in his mind as he took a look out
          the window. For the past few weeks, everyone had thought, "there's no
          way" and "everything will be okay"... And just like that, in a
          fraction of a second, the world as Denis knew it to be had crashed,
          broken into a million pieces.

          Not a few minutes later, came a second bang, an explosion not so far
          away. The heart-peircing screech of the air-raid siren filled the air
          with gloom. Every atom was shaking, as was every person in fear. There
          was no time to think of what was about to happen. As the adrenaline
          rushed through his veins, Denis ran to grab his little brother.

          They rushed down the stairs, into the basement of the building. Car
          sirens blasting outside, it seemed as if they were in a movie, yet
          this time it was not a movie, but real life. So many thoughts rushed
          through his head, yet he knew that the only priority now was to
          survive.

          The cold hard ground resonated with every explosion. As Denis and his
          brother sat there, Denis made a promise that he swore to keep until
          the day he died.
          <i
            >"No matter what happens, I promise that I will keep you safe.
            Together we can get through anything."</i
          >
          And just then and there, the realization, that nothing is ever as
          important, as being there for the ones you love, settled.
